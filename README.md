## Earthquake Dashboard Indonesia (2016–2025)
This project presents an interactive dashboard visualizing earthquake activity in Indonesia from 2016 to 2025 using Looker Studio.

## Project Overview
The dashboard analyzes seismic patterns including:
- Spatial distribution of earthquakes
- Temporal trends by year, month, and day
- Magnitude and depth distribution
- High-risk regions based on earthquake frequency

## Tools
- Looker Studio
- Data preprocessing using Python (Pandas)
- CRISP-DM methodology

## Data Source
Earthquake dataset obtained from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kekavigi/earthquakes-in-indonesia

## Data Preparation
After the data preparation stage, the dataset underwent several refinements to improve consistency and analytical readiness, resulting in the following key changes:
- The final dataset consists of 96,959 rows and 13 columns (variables).
- Date and time formats were standardized across all records.
- Missing values and data inconsistencies were successfully addressed.
- The finalized dataset was used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of the Interactive Earthquake Distribution Dashboard of Indonesia (2016–2025).

## Key Findings
After analyzing earthquake data from 2016–2025, seven key patterns were identified:
- Earthquake events are predominantly concentrated in eastern and southern Indonesia.
- The highest level of seismic activity occurred in 2025.
- The annual average magnitude remains relatively stable, ranging between 3.3 and 3.6 on the Richter scale.
- Most earthquakes in Indonesia fall into the Minor and Light magnitude categories.
- Shallow earthquakes dominate seismic activity across Indonesia.
- Sulawesi emerges as the most earthquake-prone region.
- Borneo records the highest number of major earthquakes (≥ 6.0 Richter scale).
